Screaming Strike 2 Changelog

2019/06/08 Version 2.01
From this version, the game will be distributed as a 32-bit application. Hopefully this solves various issues that prevented the game from running. Please, please do.
(1) Fixed a bug which only showed top 10 scores when viewing scoreboards with the built-in viewer(#1).
(2) Fixed some typos in the Japanese translation(#2).
(3) Fixed a bug where players were able to submit scores with blank name(#3).
(4) I forgot to mention extra life item in Japanese and English readmes, so added it(#4).
(5) Fixed a bug where the penetration effect was not actually applied regardless of its active status(#5).
(6) Fixed a bug where resetting high scores made the game instantly crash (#6).
(7) A new language "Turkish" has been added. I was expecting the first one would be Spanish, but it's not yet. Maybe I should go ask someone.
(8) Added / changed screams.
(9) I heard that the music was played strangely under certain environments, so tried changing the playing method.
(10) Pressing the S key during the gameplay now speaks your current score.
(11) Made the speed of music pitch reverting a little bit slower.
(12) Killed very very slow items. It indirectly means that nasty items spawn in a tiny bit lower percentage.
(13) When Slow down or Boost effects are active and the speed of your punch is affected, you can tell that by hearing your punching whooshes.
(14) Added two new item announcement voices: "Eric the Evil" and "Sophie".
(15) When a destruction effect is triggered and items are destroyed, good items are treated as if they were obtained, and nasty items are treated as they were destroyed. If you get a destruction by that destruction, you will gain a stored destruction that automatically protects you from being attacked. Hmm. Complicated.
(16) Pressing the tab key during the gameplay now pauses the game. While pausing, you can check the current game stats.
(17) At the result screen, you can now check the game's lasted duration and level you reached.
