# Screaming Strike  
## Intro
I decided to opensource this.  
I'm currently in process of rewriting it with Python.  
## Dependencies  
You need pygame and wx.  
pip install pygame  
pip install wx  
Most of other modules will be included in this package because I'll very likely modify them a bit.  

##Other useful commands
Note: If You're using mac, you need to use / instead of \.  
python tools\build.py  
Builds the app on win and mac.  Please read the following building section for details.  
python tools\updateTranslation.py  
Updates the translation catalog. Please read the following translating section for details.
