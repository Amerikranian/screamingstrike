Screaming Strike 2 Changelog
2019/08/07 Version 2.05
(1) Fixed a bug which made the game crash when you got too many duplicate boosts (#13).

2019/07/08 Version 2.04
(1) If it succeeded in retrieving language from the system and the retrieved language does not exist in the game, the game was crashing. I have fixed the issue.
(2) The game now detects illegal score modification like memory hacking. If your final score is detected as "hacked", the score posting process will entirely be skipped. Please report me if it is falsely detected(I highly doubt it though).
(3) After you passed level 20 or around, the number of targets required to the next level ridiculously inflated, so I set a limit.
(4) The "Collection" option in the main menu now shows how many collections you have unlocked, out of all of the available ones.

2019/06/15 Version 2.03
(1) Changed the Python compiler to use. It should now killed the most irritating bug that prevented the game from running.
(2) Fixed inconvenience when playing the game using SAPI5. Also, it now supports ctrl key for speech interruption(#8, #11).
(3) Changed so that the game modes in the log are translated (#9).

2019/06/09 Version 2.02
(1) Due to the data location change in the last version, game settings were not saved correctly. This version fix that bug(#7).

2019/06/06 Version 2.01
From this version, windows version will be distributed as a 32-bit application. Hopefully this solves various issues that prevented the game from running. Please, please do.
I have completely no idea about this, but apparently the game sometimes refuses to run without giving any errors. If it happens too often, I will think of an alternative solution, so please let me know.
(1) Fixed a bug which only showed top 10 scores when viewing scoreboards with the built-in viewer(#1).
(2) Fixed some typos in the Japanese translation(#2).
(3) Fixed a bug where players were able to submit scores with blank name(#3).
(4) I forgot to mention extra life item in Japanese and English readmes, so added it(#4).
(5) Fixed a bug where the penetration effect was not actually applied regardless of its active status(#5).
(6) Fixed a bug where resetting high scores made the game instantly crash (#6).
(7) A new language "Turkish" has been added. I was expecting the first one would be Spanish, but it's not yet. Maybe I should go ask someone.
(8) Added / changed screams.
(9) I heard that the music was played strangely under certain environments, so tried changing the playing method.
(10) Pressing the S key during the gameplay now speaks your current score.
(11) Made the speed of music pitch reverting a little bit slower.
(12) Killed very very slow items. It indirectly means that nasty items spawn in a tiny bit lower percentage.
(13) When Slow down or Boost effects are active and the speed of your punch is affected, you can tell that by hearing your punching whooshes.
(14) Added two new item announcement voices: "Eric the Evil" and "Sophie".
(15) When a destruction effect is triggered and items are destroyed, good items are treated as if they were obtained, and nasty items are treated as they were destroyed. If you get a destruction by that destruction, you will gain a stored destruction that automatically protects you from being attacked. Hmm. Complicated.
(16) Pressing the tab key during the gameplay now pauses the game. While pausing, you can check the current game stats.
(17) At the result screen, you can now check the game's lasted duration and level you reached.
(18) If the game crashes for some reason, it now displays a dialog before exiting. I didn't know how to do that; someone told me how. Thanks.
(19) I noticed that Mac users lost progress data whenever they updated the game and replaced the application bundle. So, I moved the location where the data is saved to application data directory. Although the compatibility checking / fixing is implemented for Windows, mac users can't use the automatic fix because you need to replace the app before that. Please accept the deletion, or using terminal, cd to screamingStrike2.app/Content/Resources/data and do
mkdir "/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support"
cp *.dat "/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support"
to manually rescue your progress.
